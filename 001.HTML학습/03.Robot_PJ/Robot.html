                         A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex
                         series of actions automatically.[2] A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the
                         control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots
                         are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than
                         expressive aesthetics.
                         <br /><br />
                         Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced
                         Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to
                         industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots,
                         collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even
                         microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may
                         convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to
                         proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main
                         drivers.[3]
                         <br /><br />
                         The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of
                         robots,[4] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information
                         processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place
                         of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in
                         appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing
                         to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of
                         robotics: soft robotics.
                         <br /><br />
                         From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable
                         automated devices and even automata resembling humans and other animals, such as animatronics,
                         designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial
                         age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and
                         wireless remote-control.
                         <br /><br />
                         The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot'
                         was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi
                         Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother
                         Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor.[5][6][7] Electronics evolved into the driving
                         force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by
                         William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC)
                         machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen.
                         <br /><br />
                         The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned
                         his seminal robotics company, Unimation. The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961
                         where it lifted pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant
                         in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.[8]
                         <br /><br />
                         Robots have replaced humans[9] in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer
                         not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme
                         environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the
                         increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological
                         unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.[10] The use of robots
                         in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential
                         repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.
